# Smart-Night-Light
## Background
Because of the growing insomnia in our society and the inconvenience of turning on the lights at night due to the different room structures, I created a smart night light that automatically turns on the lights when the person gets out of bed at night, so that people using it can easily find their way to the toilet or kitchen at night.

## Sensors used
### LDR

### PIR sensor

## Internal construction and wiring connections
By feeding the LDR and PIR signals to the arduino board, the LED strip is outputted to turn on when certain conditions are met, otherwise it will remain off.

## Improvement
1.LDR is sometimes not very accurate-Set the brightness in the condition to a lower setting.  
2.The box is too large-By replacing the large breadboard with a solder connection circuit and using 3d printing to create a suitable and small container to place it in, the night light is made even better looking and smaller.  
3.The PIR sometimes comes on automatically even when a person is in bed - adjust the PIR so that it only detects if there is activity directly in front of it.
## Further applications
### Place in wardrobe as sensor light

### Placed in a dimly lit stairwell to help light the way for the elderly community
